Answer: flag{3b532e0a187006879d262141e16fa5f05f2e6752}

Organizer Description:
	This challenge is an (intentionally) corrupted git repo. There are 3 corruptions overall, each one is a single bit off 
	and are all contained in individual files. Git's versioning provides enough information to rebuild the broken commits.

To distribute:
	sharpturn.tar.xz-07f57e28a86a3c8059da2584f6c5329d9e7bbe25

Setup:
	This challenge has no setup or server component. Just need to distribute the file above.

Hints:
	Hint 1 (give this out as soon as people start complaining the flag is wrong): 
		git fsck -v
	Hint 2 (don't give this one out unless they fail for days): 
		http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/236238
