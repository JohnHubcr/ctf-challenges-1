Organizer Description:
	This challenge is a simple OTP reuse. The novelty is it's EBCDIC instead of ASCII. It's simple but takes a bit of time to solve.

To distribute:
	punchout.tar.xz-4687e59f16a6b8c4def1e67dcbee2ab5d7e9cb5f

Setup:
	This challenge has no setup or server component. Just need to distribute the file above.

Hints:
	Hint 1 (don't give this one out unless they fail for days):
		Ask them what code page system/360 used.
