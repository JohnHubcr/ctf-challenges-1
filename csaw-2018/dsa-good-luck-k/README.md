# Good Luck, 'k?

This is a CTF that was used at CSAW CTF 2018. Participants were given `main.py` and an endpoint running the docker container.

If you'd like to try it yourself you can generate the docker container with the `build-container.sh` script and then run it with `docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 csaw`. This will give you a server running on port 5000 that you can query. Good luck!
